# FMCG_Supply_Chain_Breakdown_Dashboard
FMCG_Supply_Chain_Breakdown Power BI Dashboard


I had used a sample dataset from Kaggle. The files were in CSV format and I cleaned some data in these files by filling the gaps with NaN values, removing duplicates, removing inconsistencies like 1 written as "one" etc. After this, I connected this CSV data source with Power BI and completed the Dashboard with actionable insights that any one at this hypothetical FMCG company could work on.

MAIN KPIs:

No of  Floof Proof Houses
Govt Check in last 3 months
Storage Issue in last 3 months
Product weight in Tonnes shipped in last 3 months
Warehouse Breakdown in last 3 months

How did I manage to come to these KPIs?
The data was mainly about flood affected, electricty failure affected, storage issues, and other things. Also in the problem statement it is clearly mentioned that one has to make a dashboard where the target variable is the breakdown causing factors. From both these points it was data driven decision to track the above KPIs in my dashboard. 


Visualizations Used:

Bar Chart
Line and Bar Chart
Line Chart
Tree Map

Challenges:

Data Cleaning: Converting the CSVs to Excel and vice versa after cleaning. Used simple excel functions to clean and preprocess the data before loading it into the database.
